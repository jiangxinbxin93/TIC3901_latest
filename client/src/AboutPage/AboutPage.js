Also, The dance symbolizes the eternal fight between good and evil.Of all classical Indian dances, Kathakali is the most elaborate one.

      <h1>History of Kathakali</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>The perfectly developed style of Kathakali originated somewhere around the 17th century. However, it is an art that has evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms. Which had existed in the southern region in ancient times.Adapted mostly from the Indian epics, like Ramayana, Mahabharata, and others. the dancer expresses himself with codified hasta mudras (hand gestures) and facial expressions.</p>
      <p> The technical details include all the parts i.e. from facial muscles to fingers, eyes, hands, and much more . The movement of the eyebrows, the eyeballs and the lower eyelids as described in the Natya Shastra are used to the very maximum in Kathakali. And the weight of the body is kept on the outer edges of the feet, which are slightly bent and curved, and give the performer a wonderful posture to hold.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>Kathakali is a chiefly interpretative dance form, where the characters become the dominant and important part of traditional Kerala dance forms.The characters in a Kathakali performance are broadly divided into satvika, rajasika and tamasika types.Satvika characters are noble, heroic, generous and refined, and are therefore grouped under certain clearly defined types like the pacha, kathi, thadi, kari or minukku.
    Kathakali is the only dance style using the entire body.</p>

      <p>Pacha is a character type that belongs to the pious, gentle, and noble characters in the stories taken up for performance in Kathakali. In Pacha, the color green dominates, and the performers all wear headgear. Therefore, Krishna and Rama wear special crowns decorated with peacock feathers. This also makes noble characters like Indra, Arjun, and the Devas some of the Pacha characters. Pacha depicts the vibrant characters in Kathakali to the very peak.</p>

The make-up of Kathakali can be classified into the teppu, chuttikuthu and uduthukettu. The actor himself does the teppu. Each character has a distinct teppu. However, the experts who specialize in make-up are the ones who do the second stage. Uduthukettu is the wearing of huge billowing skirts.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>Music is central to a Kathakali performance, setting the mood and triggering emotions resonant with the nature of the scene.It sets the mood for the Vibrant characters in Kathakali.</p>
    <p>Chenda, Maddalam, Chengila, Ilathalam, Idakka, and Shankhu are what comprise the orchestra in other traditional performing arts of Kerala. Some major musical patterns, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: Chempada (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene), Adantha (scenes involving kings or divine beings), Muri Adantha musical style (for comic, light-hearted, or fast-moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).</p>

      <h1>The Acting</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>Ilakiattam is the part of the performance when the characters get an opportunity to demonstrate their excellence in abhinaya (Acting). However, for most part of the act or performance, the dancers engage themselves in chodiattam, which means to act in strict conformity to the words in the padams sung by the musicians. There are 24 main mudras, and numerous more minor ones in Kathakali. The Navrasa are nice facial characters, which each actor masters through facial muscle control during his education, in order to express the emotional state of the character in the play.</p>
    <p>The classical Sanskrit texts provide the theory behind Navarasas, such as Natya Shastra. But they are sometimes found with different names, which happens in cases of classical Indian dances as well. The Navarasa express nine Bhava (emotions) in Kathakali and give the vibrant characters of Kathakali the edge they require.</p>
